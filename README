MythRip should run on any machine which meets the following dependencies:

  * Python 2.6 
  * wxWidgets 2.6 or greater
 
When ran on a machine which is already a working mythfrontend, it should 
require no configuration in order to communicate with MythTV.  If there 
is trouble, the MythTV tab in preferences allows you to alter the 
connection parameters.

To run mythrip from the unpacked distributed tarball, run:

   $ ./mythrip

To install mythrip, run (as root):

   # python setup.py install

..and start it with:

   $ mythrip
