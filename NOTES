dependencies:

  python2.6 (tested on this version only so far	)

  whatever the python mythtv bindings require...



todo:
  
  incorporate newest mythtv python bindings

  codec & audio improvements

  encoder option strings ending with : cause trouble due to ::pass=2

  - something seems to have caused mythrip to stop encoder progress
  ** it always stops on pass 2 around 52% ; could it be some kind of full file object?
